# Til the Cows Come Home        
## 题目描述    
Bessie is out in the field and wants to get back to the barn to get as much sleep as possible before Farmer John wakes her for the morning milking. Bessie needs her beauty sleep, so she wants to get back as quickly as possible.   
Farmer John's field has N (2 <= N <= 1000) landmarks in it, uniquely numbered 1..N. Landmark 1 is the barn; the apple tree grove in which Bessie stands all day is landmark N. Cows travel in the field using T (1 <= T <= 2000) bidirectional cow-trails of various lengths between the landmarks. Bessie is not confident of her navigation ability, so she always stays on a trail from its start to its end once she starts it.   
Given the trails between the landmarks, determine the minimum distance Bessie must walk to get back to the barn. It is guaranteed that some such route exists.  
## 题目翻译  
John的农田里有N个地标，从1到N编号。Bessie要从N号走到1号，求她要走的最短路的长度。  
## 输入格式  
* Line 1: Two integers: T and N   
* Lines 2..T+1: Each line describes a trail as three space-separated integers. The first two integers are the landmarks between which the trail travels. The third integer is the length of the trail, range 1..100.  
## 输出格式  
* Line 1: A single integer, the minimum distance that Bessie must travel to get from landmark N to landmark 1.

## 题目分析  	
这道题是求最短路长度，这里用的算法是Dijkstra，套模板就行，题目有点坑，两点间的路未必只有一条，所以输入需要处理一下。具体实现见代码。  
## 代码示例  
 ```c++	
#include<iostream>
#include<cstring>
using namespace std;
#define INF 0x3f3f3f3f
#define Max 1010
int t,n;
int cost[Max][Max];//两点的距离
int d[Max];//顶点出发的最短距离
bool used[Max];//访问标记
//求从起点出发到每个顶点的最短距离
void Dijkstra(){
    d[n] = 0;
    while(true){
        int v = -1;
        //从尚未使用的点中选择一个距离最小的点
        for(int u=1; u<=n; u++){
            if(!used[u] && (v==-1 || d[u] <d[v])) v = u;
        }
        if(v == -1)break;
        used[v] = true;
        for(int u=1; u<=n; u++){
            d[u] = min(d[u], d[v]+cost[v][u]);//进行松弛
        }
    }
}
int main(){
    cin >> t >> n;
    int u, v, c;
    memset(cost, INF, sizeof(cost));
    memset(d, INF, sizeof(d));
    memset(used, 0, sizeof(used));
    for(int i=0; i<t; i++){
        cin >> u >> v >> c;
        if(c < cost[u][v]){//两点间的路未必只有一条
            cost[u][v] = c;
            cost[v][u] = c;
        }
    }
    Dijkstra();
    cout << d[1] ;
    return 0;
}
```
